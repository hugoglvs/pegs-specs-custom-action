// The System book refines the Goal one by focusing on more detailed requirements
// about the system under development, mainly its constituents, behaviors and properties.

== Components
// Overall structure expressed by the list of major software and, if applicable, hardware parts.

== Functionality
// One section for each of the components identified above, describing the corresponding behaviors.

== Interfaces
// How the system makes the functionality available to the rest of the world (UI/API).

== Detailed usage scenarios
// Examples of interaction between the environment and the system: use cases, user stories.

== Prioritization
// Classification of the behaviors, interfaces and scenarios by their degree of criticality.

== Verification and acceptance criteria
// Specification of the conditions under which an implementation will be deemed satisfactory.
